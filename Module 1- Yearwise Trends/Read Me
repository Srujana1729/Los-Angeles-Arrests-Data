In this analysis, we try to get a sense of how the number of arrests has changed over the years. 
Through a series of plots, we identify overall trends in the number of arrests, and explore what gives rise to these trends.
The code and results are shared here in markdown format.
Note: The plots are numbered based on the numbering in the markdown file.
